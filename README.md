# PyFileBinder


![avatar](https://github.com/wxi3/PyFileBinder/blob/main/usage.png)

Tips: The program will generate a python file named binder.py. When running this file, self deletion can be implemented, but when using packaging tools such as pyinstaller to package, self deletion cannot be implemented


HELP：I don't know how to realize the self deletion function. If you know anything, please leave a message。
